              <li>
                Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric
                information, and other information provided or entered by the
                user.

                Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access
                management process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the

              <li>
                Authorization works through settings that are implemented and

            Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
            implement authentication?
          </h5>

            <b>Why are you using firebase?</b> <br />
            Indeed, Firebase is a less technical and time-saving alternative to
            writing full-fledged backend code for dynamic apps. With Firebase,
            it's pretty simple to connect and use built-in third-party
            authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, among
            others. And if you want to use a pre-built authentication UI, you
            have it at your disposal as well.
